Hook: The lakehouse does not remove the need for a high-performance warehouse engine. It raises the bar for one.

Paragraph 1 - Acknowledge why lakehouse platforms are winning attention.
Paragraph 2 - Explain what happens after open data lands: enterprise teams still need fast, governed query execution.
Paragraph 3 - Where Netezza should lead:
- Warehouse-grade performance for repeat analytics
- Iceberg, object storage, and watsonx.data adjacency
- Hybrid control for regulated workloads
- Cost discipline for high-volume SQL
Paragraph 4 - The right question is not warehouse versus lakehouse. It is which engine runs which workload.
